This a bash script to ping in all ips at a specific subnet and print a message " up and running " when ping success and " unreeachable " when ping fail 
  #!/bin/bash

  subnet="192.168.8"
  for host in {0..250}; do
      ip="$subnet.$host"
      if ping -c 1 "$ip" &> /dev/null; then
        echo "Server $ip is up and running."
      else
          echo "Server $ip is unreachable."
      fi
  done
 bash

 
########Explanation##############################


 1. *#!/bin/bash:*
    
   - This line is called a shebang. It indicates the path to the interpreter that will execute the script. In this case, it specifies that the script should be run using the Bash shell.

2. *subnet="192.168.8.1":*
   
   - This line defines the subnet we want to ping. It sets the variable subnet to the value "192.168.8.1".

4. *for host in {0..250}; do:*
5. 
   - This line starts a loop that iterates from 0 to 250, inclusive. It sets the variable host to each value in this range.

6. *ip="$subnet.$host":*
   
   - This line constructs the IP address to ping by concatenating the subnet variable with the current value of the host variable.

8. *if ping -c 1 "$ip" &> /dev/null; then:*
   
   - This line pings the constructed IP address ($ip) with a count of 1 packet (-c 1). If the ping succeeds, the ping command returns a zero exit status, and the if statement evaluates to true.

10. *echo "Server $ip is up and running.":*
    
   - If the ping succeeds, this line prints a message indicating that the server at the IP address is up and running.

11. *else:*
    
   - If the ping fails (the ping command returns a non-zero exit status), the execution flow moves to the else block.

11. *echo "Server $ip is unreachable.":*
    
   - This line prints a message indicating that the server at the IP address is unreachable.

11. *fi:*
    
   - This line marks the end of the if statement.

11. *done:*
    
    - This line marks the end of the for loop.
